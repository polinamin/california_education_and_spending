## Evaluating the State of Californiaâ€™s Higher Education

### Problem Statement
Given the current per-pupil spending in California, this analysis will look at whether:
1. Students are achieving satisfactory educational outcomes, and
2. The current budget is related to improvements in educational outcomes.

<br>Analysis will be conducted at the county level, and limited to the year 2018-19. ACT and SAT results will be used as proxies to understand educational outcomes.

### Background
Total state budget for public TK-12 education in 2018-19 in California was USD97.2 billion. The state spent USD55.4 billion on institutions supporting high-school education (taken as a sum of spending by Unified and High School Agencies). 

This analysis looks at whether the allocated budget is enough to achieve the desired educational outcomes.

**Approach** 
* Evaluate educational outcomes achieved in 2018-19: Compare county-level educational outcomes (SAT and ACT results) to assess:
    * County-level performance relative to national benchmarks
    * County performance ranking with respect to educational outcomes
* Review per-pupil expenditures: Determine per-pupil county-level spending allocated for high-school students, in order to determine:
    * Whether higher spending has any bearing on better educational outcomes

### Conclusions and Next Steps
1. Just 43.4% of California students met or exceeded the SAT benchmark.
    - While 56% of students met or exceeded the ACT benchmark, fewer students take the ACT
2. California students fare worse in Mathematics than English, Reading, or Writing
    - SAT and ACT outcomes in mathematics were closely related, implying that interventions and variables impacting performance in mathematics, impacts test-takers for both tests 
3. Higher spending per pupil did not result in better educational outcomes

**Next Steps in the Analysis**
1. Confirm that SAT and ACT results:
    - How well they reflect educational outcomes
    - How they relate to acceptance and success criteria in post-secondary education
    - How they compare to other factors that evaluate educational outcomes, especially with respect to accounting for geographic and economic dispersion, English proficiency, and diversity and representation
2. Review spending per student calculations to finalize outcomes
3. Consider conducting a cohort-based analysis, to see whether a continuous 4-year investment results in improved educational outcomes
4. Define and evaluate factors that impact resource allocation in education
5. Conduct time-series analysis to test factors identified as having a significant impact on resource allocation effectiveness for education outcomes
